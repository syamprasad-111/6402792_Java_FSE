Financial Forecasting – Using Recursion

Description:
Predicts future investment value based on a constant annual growth rate using recursive algorithms. Demonstrates both basic recursion and an optimized memoized version.

Files:
FinanceForecast.java – Basic recursive implementation
FinanceForecastOptimized.java – Optimized version using memorization i.e a hash map.

Time & Space Complexity:
| Implementation       | Time Complexity  |  Space Complexity  |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Basic Recursion      | O(n)             | O(n) (stack calls) |
| Memoized Recursion   | O(n)             | O(n) (cached calls)|

n = number of years of forecast

Optimization Strategies:
1. Memoization
Store previously computed values in a map to avoid redundant recursive calls.

2. Iteration
Convert recursion into a loop to eliminate stack usage — ideal for large year ranges.
