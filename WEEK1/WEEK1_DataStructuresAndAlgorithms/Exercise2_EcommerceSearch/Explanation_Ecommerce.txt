Ecommerce Searching – Linear vs Binary Search on Product Data

Description
Implements both linear and binary search algorithms on a product dataset, each product having a productId, productName, and category. Demonstrates search efficiency and suitability for e-commerce platforms.

Files
Product.java – Represents product attributes
Test.java – Main class using Scanner for input and runs both search methods

Time Complexity Comparison:
| Search Type      | Best Case | Average Case  | Worst Case  |
|------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Linear Search    | O(1)      | O(n)          | O(n)        |
| Binary Search    | O(1)      | O(log n)      | O(log n)    |

Linear Search: Good for unsorted or small datasets.
Binary Search: Fast and scalable for sorted arrays.

Recommendation for E-Commerce Systems
Linear Search : For small or unsorted product lists
Binary Search : For sorted arrays and performance-critical search and When data is mostly static(read-heavy).
For large dynamic datasets, prefer:
->HashMap for O(1) lookup.
->Search trees / Tries for text-based queries.
